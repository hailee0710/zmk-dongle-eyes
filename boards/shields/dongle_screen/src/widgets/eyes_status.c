 * just its pupil. Every expression is either a rounded bar or a polyline
 * traced by the same point-builder vocabulary (see rounded_rect/clip_below
 * and the set_*_points functions below), filled and/or stroked into the
 * small shared framebuffer apply_geometry() owns (helpers/display.h) rather
 * than built from lv_obj/lv_line/lv_canvas objects - see CLAUDE.md's "The
 * ZMK v0.3 framebuffer port" for why: ZMK v0.3's LVGL 8.3 doesn't have the
 * object/style API this widget was originally written against, and drawing
 * pixels directly sidesteps that instead of translating every call site.
 * Dialogue and the sleep z's stay real LVGL labels regardless - see
 * eyes_status.h.
 *
 * On any layer other than base the expression reports the layer, because
 * knowing where you are beats personality. On the base layer the eyes are
 * driven by activity and typing speed instead.

// The eyes are centred in it, which on a box this size puts them at the

// carve out empty space above the eyes for the dialogue to live in. This one
